### [Project 1: Extinct Languages - An investigation of the effects of colonization](https://github.com/RubyRondina/Project-1--Extinct-Languages)
**Tableau, Google Sheets**

A study on the world's extinct, endangered and vulnerable languages.  Where in the globe are these languages located?  My hypothesis is that most of them come from former British and Spanish colonies.  Let's see if that is indeed the case.


### [Project 2: Rolling 30-day retention](https://github.com/RubyRondina/SQL_Project_30DayRetention)
**SQL, BigQuery, Google Sheets**

Investigating a mobile game company’s player retention.  Of specific interest is counting rolling 30-day retention and expressing it as a fraction of the total playerbase at the time, as well as calculating retention by age group.


### [Project 3: Foreign Aid in the New Millenium - Ranking Donors and Recipients](https://github.com/RubyRondina/Foreign-Aid)
**Tableau, Google Sheets**

A study on the world's top donors and recipients of foreign aid in terms of dollar value and percentage of gross national income (GNI), as well as a brief investigation on Canada's foreign aid contribution and flows since the year 2000.


### [Project 4: Covid-19 in Ontario Public Schools](https://github.com/RubyRondina/Python-Project---Covid-Cases-In-Ontario-Schools)
**Python**

An analysis on a possible correlation between high enrolment numbers and high covid cases in Ontario public schools.  This study was done prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant.


### [Project 5: Google Analytics, Google Merchandise E-commerce Store](https://github.com/RubyRondina/CapstoneProject)
**Python, SQL, BigQuery, Tableau**

An exploration on the different variables in the Google Analytics Sample Dataset housed on BigQuery Public, to see which variables, if any, had an effect on Total Global Revenue for the December 2016 and January 2017 time period.
